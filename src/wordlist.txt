The sun sets
Birds chirp
She reads books
The cat ran
Coffee warms me
He jogs daily
They played soccer
Flowers bloom
I watch movies
She sings well
The dog barks
He rides bikes
We visited museums
The cake tastes good
Rain fell softly
She painted well
The baby giggles
I have a meeting
Stars twinkle
He writes stories
The wind howls
They danced happily
I love cooking
The car zooms
She wears red
The library is quiet
We went to the beach
The clock struck
She plays piano
The garden grows
He drew a dragon
The soup is hot
I found a coin
The phone rang
She bought flowers
Snow covers everything
He arrives early
The fish swim
She collects seashells
The kids laugh
I wrote a letter
The moon glows
He fixed the chair
Thunder rumbled
She baked cookies
Clouds drift by
I watched the sunrise
The ice cream melts
He tied his shoes
She picked apples
The train is on time
They shared toys
The soup simmers
I walked in the park
Grass is green
He finished homework
She enjoyed the day
Keys jingled
I drew in the sand
The dog barked
The sun warms
He found a map
The car broke down
She watched clouds
I started a hobby
The butterfly flutters
He played games
She smiled sweetly
Water sparkles
I cleaned today
The old tree stands
She tied her hair
He painted the fence
Stars fell down
I learned to dance
The baby sleeps
She wrote a poem
Waves crashed
I hugged my friend
The pizza is hot
He wore a hat
The rain stopped
She found a talent
The road winds
He cooked dinner
The kitten purrs
I read an article
The movie surprised me
She planted a tree
The clock ticks
He learned to ride
The flowers smell nice
I organized books
Leaves change colors
She danced joyfully
The alarm rings
I enjoyed the night
The sunset glows
She whispered a secret
i wish i could do that
